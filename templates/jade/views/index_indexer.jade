       You can access any variable you set in your configuration file from the `view` object.
       Basically your configuration file is passed to the view as the `view` object.

       Data comes with a `byGroupAndType` key which contains the data tree
       with groups as first level (default group is named `undefined`),
       types as second level (`function`, `variable` or `mixin`), items as third level.
       So: `groups > types > items`.

           data.byGroupAndType = {
               'undefined': {
                   'function': [ ... ],
                   'mixin': [ ... ],
                   'variable': [ ... ]
               }
           }

       For extra informations about the `data` interface, be sure to have a look at the wiki:

       To display our items, we need to:
       1. Loop over `data.byGroupAndType` groups
       2. Loop over types mapped to each group
       3. Loop over items mapped to each type

    //- 1. Loop over the groups in `data.byGroupAndType`
    each group, group_name in data.byGroupAndType
      section
        //- Retrieve group alias if any (else group name)
        h1= group_name

        //- 2. Loop over the types in the current group
        each items, type in group

          //- If items to be displayed in type
          if items.length > 0
            section
              h2= type

              //- 3. Loop over the items in the current type
              each item in items

                //- At this point it is up to you to display whatever you want from your items.
                h3= item.context.name

    //-
       If your theme needs some JavaScript, feel free to create a JS file in `assets/js/` folder
       and include it as follow:

           script(src="assets/js/main.js")
